# 2Day for Windows

![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2day/branch/master)

[2Day](https://www.2day-app.com) is a todo-list application for Windows devices (Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile). It's built on top of .Net, C# and XAML. 

2Day was created by a single guy as a side project and then turned into a 5+ years experiencing of having and maintaining the app in the Windows Store. As I joined Microsoft in late 2017 I'm no longer developing the app. That's the reason why I decided to put the code on GitHub. Even though I'm not doing active development I will be more than happy to welcome developers who want to hack into the code and/or fix or improve things.

**PRs are welcome**. 

For significant new changes, I will push an update to the Windows Store.

## Building the app

Visual Studio 2017 is required to build the source. Any edition will work. You can get Visual Studio 2017 Community for free [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

* Make sure you select a valid target (x86, x64 or ARM)
* Set _2Day.App_ as startup project
